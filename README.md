# xyz_to_hdf5

Main Goal of this repository is to create  a data set from xyz format to hdf5

Step One :

Organise your Data Set with an architecture:
Example:
            Data set-> Object Category 1
                    -> Object Category 2
                    -> ....



Step Two  :  Put the .py into the folder with  .xyz and normalize all the name  
ex: Dog-1 ...Dog-56 ... Dog-5764  

It makes a .txt with a list of new file 
  ex: Dog1.txt 
      Dog2.txt


Do it for each category
